## Hello there 👋

I'm Lucas, a first-year student at Algosup with a passion for software engineering and IT.

💻 Currently, I am dedicated to my studies at Algosup, striving to learn as much as I can about IT to become a proficient software engineer. Together with a friend, we are working on a long-term project to develop a video game, and we are committed to making it the best it can be.

🌍 With an open mind and a global perspective, I had the unique opportunity to live in Dakar, Senegal, for 3 years during my youth. This experience immersed me in a culture vastly different from that of France, broadening my understanding of the world and human interactions.

✈️ I have a love for traveling, which continually expands my vision of the world, humanity, and myself.

🎮 Through my interest in video games, I've honed essential soft skills such as perseverance, creativity, leadership, and strategic thinking, which are invaluable in a professional setting.
